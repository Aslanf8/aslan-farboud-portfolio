THIS REPORT IS FOR ADVISING ONLY
THIS REPORT IS A TOOL USED TO UNDERSTAND DEGREE REQUIREMENTS AND IS NOT MEANT TO REPLACE 
PERSONAL ACADEMIC ADVISING.
 
Report Accuracy
Although efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of this report, it is the responsibility of each student to be aware 
of the requirements as stated in the relevant SFU calendar.
 
Applying Units To Your Credential
Students registered in multiple programs (any combination of Honours/Major/Minor) should check to make sure that units 
for upper division courses are assigned to one program or the other, but not both. 
Units applied to one certificate may also be applied to Honours/Major/Minor degree programs, but may not be applied to 
another SFU certificate or diploma.
Note: Repeated course(s) currently In Progress will only be counted towards satisfying the program requirement(s) after 
receiving the final grade. The APR may erroneously double count the repeated course towards program requirements 
while it is In Progress; once the final grade is received, the course with the lower grade will be excluded. Please re-run the
APR after receiving your final grade to review your outstanding requirements. Contact your Academic Advisor for more 
information.
 
In progress courses
In progress courses are treated as if they are completed satisfactorily.
 
LIMITS ON COURSE REPEATS
The number of courses which a student may repeat in an undergraduate degree program is limited to five. You have
